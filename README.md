# Hello there, I'm Carlos Kassab 🖖🏽

I'm a recent grad in **Computer Science** @ UAG. 

Currently working @ Oracle, but also looking into doing a Masters degree in japan or getting a job there! 
If interested in working together, please contact me 💌.

Some of the things that really drive me are: **challenges 🌟**, **new technologies** (looking at you, Blazor 🔥), **Unicycling 🚴🏽‍♂️**
